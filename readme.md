Features to implement
1 - Recursively search for .ksc files in subdirectories.
2 - jump if the file is already converted (check for .jpeg file with same name).
3 - Logging system to keep track of conversions.
4 - Measure-time for conversion and display it.
5 - Open file automatically after conversion.
6 - Header check to ensure the file is a valid KSC file.
7 - output file can be specified with a different name or path.

Also, I did not check the program to see if it works or not. Because I do not have Knight Online Installed to take .ksc file and I could not find any .ksc file in my computer.
