# KSC to JPEG Converter

This project is a C-based utility for converting `.ksc` files (used in Knight Online) into `.jpeg` image format.  
‚ö†Ô∏è The core logic is implemented, but **several features are pending implementation**. Also, the program hasn't been tested due to the unavailability of `.ksc` files.

## ‚ùó Disclaimer

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The tool has not been tested as no valid `.ksc` files were available during development. Knight Online is not installed, and no `.ksc` samples could be located.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented:
- Basic conversion from `.ksc` to `.jpeg`.

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented:

1. **Recursive Search**  
   Automatically search for `.ksc` files in subdirectories.

2. **Skip Already Converted Files**  
   Skip processing if a corresponding `.jpeg` file already exists.

3. **Logging System**  
   Log each conversion (success/failure) to a file for auditing or debugging.

4. **Conversion Time Measurement**  
   Measure and display how long each conversion takes.

5. **Auto-Open Output**  
   Automatically open the converted file once the process is complete.

6. **Header Validation**  
   Validate input files to ensure they are real `.ksc` files before processing.

7. **Custom Output File Name/Path**  
   Allow the user to specify a different output filename or path.
